Graph Design: Degree of Separation

• Designed a C++ language-based algorithm which processes IMDb’s large database of information as input and accurately identifies the shortest path of affiliation between any two actors provided.
• Processed over 1.3 million data entries of actors and associated project information. Analyzed data to develop a most effective graph model to organize the various data fields associated to each data entry.
• Efficiently utilized C++ API documentation to evaluate, implement, and test the various data structures utilized in the graph model in order to optimize the graph’s build time and the runtime for shortest path search.
